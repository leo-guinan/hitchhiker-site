The future of work isn't remote vs. office. It isn't four-day weeks or unlimited PTO. It's **observable games with bounded commitments**—roles you can try on, seasons with clean exits, and coordination that doesn't require static identity.

This guide is for people who've already left the old frame and want to see the map.

## The old frame

Work was built on **static identity**. One job title. One employer. One career narrative. The system required it: pensions, benefits, org charts, performance reviews. You had to stay still long enough for the machine to categorize you.

That's breaking. Not because of technology alone—because the people who see what's coming can't stay still. They iterate faster than the forms allow. The best workers are the worst fits for the old structure.

## The trap

Maximum clarity, minimum coordination. You know what you're good at. You know what you want to build. But the only games on offer are **unbounded**—join our community, commit to our mission, become one of us. No exit. No observable outcome. No way to play for a season and leave clean.

So you either opt out (and lose coordination) or opt in (and lose agency). The future of work is the infrastructure that lets you do both.

## The solution: observable games

Work becomes **games with rules**. Not metaphorically—literally. You accept a role. The role has a scope, a duration, and a definition of done. You play the game. When the season ends, you exit. No legacy entanglement. No identity capture.

That requires:

1. **Bounded commitments** – "I will do X for Y time, and we'll know we're done when Z."
2. **Observable outcomes** – Progress and results are legible. No black-box performance reviews.
3. **Clean exits** – When the game ends, the commitment ends. No guilt, no trailing obligations.

## What to build next

- **Seasonal roles** – Define roles that last a quarter, a project, or a deliverable. Then end.
- **Observable deliverables** – Make "done" legible. No moving goalposts.
- **Exit protocols** – How you leave clean. Handoffs, documentation, no ghosting.

The future of work is the future of coordination. Build the games.
