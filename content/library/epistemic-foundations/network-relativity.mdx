title: Network Relativity
excerpt: Truth claims are observer-dependent; specify your frame.
---

## Overview

**Network Relativity** is the principle that truth claims are observer-dependent. To avoid wasted arguments and miscoordination, specify your frame explicitly.

## Application

- When evaluating "the data shows…" arguments, ask: *From whose measurement frame?*
- In cross-team or cross-org discussions, state the network (and thus the observation set) you're reasoning from before making claims.

## Field manual

- **When to use:** Any time reality is contested or multiple parties are interpreting the same evidence differently.
- **When not to use:** When the frame is already shared and uncontested.

## Failure modes

- Collapsing all frames into one "objective" view.
- Assuming your frame is the default without stating it.

## Observable outcomes

- Fewer disputes that are really frame mismatches.
- Clearer separation of "we disagree on measurement" vs "we disagree on interpretation."
