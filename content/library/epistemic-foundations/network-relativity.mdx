## What It Is

Truth claims are not absolute — they are frame-dependent. Every observer in a network sees a different set of problems based on their position. There is no objective view, only local views that are each valid within their context.

## What It Produces

- Frame comparisons (how the same reality looks from different positions)
- Transform-invariant claims (truths that hold across multiple frames)
- "Rotate the axes" reasoning (reframing problems by changing measurement dimensions)
- Power-aware interpretations (who can see what, and why)

## When to Use It

- When someone claims the data proves X (without specifying their frame)
- When politics collapses to a single axis (left/right, progressive/conservative)
- When a model result feels real but you can't explain why
- When different groups seem to disagree on basic facts
- When you're trying to understand why brilliant people reach opposite conclusions

## How to Apply It

1. Identify the implicit coordinate system: What exactly is being measured? What is the observer sampling?
2. Identify the observer's position: Where are they in the network? What can they see from there?
3. Identify the transformation pipeline: How does raw reality become the metric they're discussing?
4. Ask: "If we rotate the axes, does the geometry still hold?" (Is this truth frame-dependent or invariant?)
5. Map what becomes visible/invisible from different positions
6. Test whether claims are position-specific or universal

## Where It Breaks

- When observers are hidden (platform algorithms, missing data, selection effects)
- When people treat frames as ideology (mistake their frame for reality)
- When the system is too opaque to see the transformation pipeline
- When comparing across incommensurable frames (domains with no shared reference points)

## Who It's For

Researchers, analysts, political interpreters, ML evaluation teams, founders making strategy decisions, anyone trying to understand disagreement

## Examples

- **Tech vs. Rural**: Tech observer sees innovation constraints. Rural observer sees infrastructure gaps. Same economy, different frame.
- **CEO vs. Front-line Employee**: CEO sees macro trends. Employee sees daily friction. Both correct. Different positions.
- **Startup vs. Enterprise**: Startup optimizes for speed. Enterprise optimizes for stability. Both strategies make sense from their frame.
- **AI Safety vs. AI Capabilities**: Safety researcher sees risk trajectories. Capabilities researcher sees capability ceiling. Different measurement frames.

## Observable Outcomes

- Fewer wasted arguments (you understand why people disagree)
- Ability to translate between frames (what looks like risk in one frame is opportunity in another)
- Better predictions (you can see what each group will do because you understand their constraints)
- Reduced false dichotomies (you see the geometry instead of just the opposition)
