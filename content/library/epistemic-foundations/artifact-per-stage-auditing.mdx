title: Artifact-per-Stage Auditing (Pipeline Legibility)
excerpt: Every stage in a process must emit stable artifacts, manifests, and checksums. This creates a trail you can follow.

## What It Is

Every stage in a process must emit stable artifacts (outputs), manifests (metadata), and checksums (verification). This creates a trail you can follow, making debugging possible and replication reproducible.

## What It Produces

- Debuggable pipelines (you can see where things went wrong)
- Replicable science (others can follow your exact steps)
- Deterministic "where did it change?" diffs (you know which stage introduced error)
- Confidence in results (you can audit the path)

## When to Use It

- Research replication (you need to show your work)
- ML training pipelines (debugging model behavior)
- High-stakes decision systems (you need audit trails)
- Any pipeline with hidden transformations
- Data science workflows
- Complex institutional processes

## How to Apply It

1. Force every stage to output:
   - Input snapshot (what came in?)
   - Transform specification (what operations happened?)
   - Output snapshot (what came out?)
   - Metadata + hashes (proof nothing changed)
   - Intermediate tables/artifacts (show your work)
2. Verify checksums at each stage
3. Make all artifacts inspectable
4. Document the schema for each artifact
5. Enable diff analysis (compare artifacts between runs)

## Where It Breaks

- When artifacts are too expensive to create (storage, compute constraints)
- When the transform is non-deterministic (randomness, external systems)
- When you can't inspect artifacts (proprietary systems, legal restrictions)
- When there are too many stages to manage

## Who It's For

ML engineers, reproducibility people, technical founders, research teams, anyone who needs to debug complex processes

## Examples

- **ML Pipeline**: Data input → preprocessing artifact → model input artifact → model output artifact → post-processing artifact → final result. Each with hash.
- **Research**: Raw data → cleaning spec + output → analysis spec + output → results. Fully auditable.
- **Decision process**: Input docs → analysis artifacts → recommendation artifact → outcome artifact. Can trace what changed outcomes.

## Observable Outcomes

- Ability to reproduce results exactly
- Fast debugging (you know where things diverged)
- High confidence in findings (full audit trail)
- Better collaboration (others can follow your work)
