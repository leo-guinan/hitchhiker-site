## What It Is

Before debating interpretation, validate reality contact. Separate measurement disputes (did this actually happen?) from interpretive disputes (what does it mean?). Most arguments fail because people are fighting on the wrong level.

## What It Produces

- Clean separation of measurement vs. interpretation debates
- Fewer wasted arguments
- Shared ground truth before fighting over meaning
- Clear map of what's actually in dispute

## When to Use It

- Before any major argument or decision debate
- Before accepting a paper conclusion
- Before accepting an LLM's analysis
- When a political debate is spiraling
- When teams can't agree on basic facts
- When evaluating institutional claims

## How to Apply It

1. **Verify inputs**: What data are we starting with? Is it accurate? Can we check it independently?
2. **Verify transforms**: What mathematical/logical operations were applied? Are they correct?
3. **Verify outputs**: What result did we get? Can we replicate it?
4. **Verify invariants**: Are there properties that *must* hold true if this is right? Do they?
5. Only after all four: Interpret what it means
6. Document where agreement ends and interpretation begins

## Where It Breaks

- When people want interpretive fights (because it's status, not truth-seeking)
- When one party won't show their work
- When the system is too complex to trace through
- When stakeholders prefer consensus over correctness

## Who It's For

Writers, analysts, debaters, scientists, founders, anyone who needs to resolve factual disagreements before strategic decisions

## Examples

- **Political debate**: Agree on unemployment numbers (inputs), agree on measurement method (transforms), agree on result (outputs), THEN debate what it means.
- **Product decision**: Confirm user data is correct, confirm analysis method, confirm metric result, THEN debate strategy implications.
- **Research paper**: Walk through data collection, statistical method, result verification before debating implications.

## Observable Outcomes

- Arguments resolve faster (no more fighting about facts while discussing strategy)
- Less emotional heat (people separate ego from data)
- Clearer decision-making (strategy debates happen with shared reality)
- Better learning (you know where beliefs diverge from evidence)
