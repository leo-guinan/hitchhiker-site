title: ABC Systems (Legibility Wrapping)
excerpt: Complex systems become composable and auditable when you wrap black boxes. A = contract/action, B = black box, C = verifier/criteria.

## What It Is

Complex systems become composable and auditable when you wrap black boxes. A = contract/action (what goes in), B = black box (untrusted system), C = verifier/criteria (checking outputs). This separates concerns so you can trust the whole without trusting each part.

## What It Produces

- Stable interfaces (you know what to expect from black boxes)
- Auditable systems (you can verify outputs without understanding inputs)
- Composable modules (different black boxes can work together)
- Graceful degradation (when B fails, you know because C detects it)

## When to Use It

- Any time you depend on something you don't control (LLMs, third-party APIs, vendors)
- Any time you want to turn "magic" into engineering
- Building ML systems where you don't trust all components
- Institutional design (you can't trust everyone, but you can verify results)
- Creating auditable processes

## How to Apply It

1. Define A clearly: What is the input contract? What must be true for this to work?
2. Treat B as untrusted: Don't assume it works. Design for failure.
3. Build C independently: How can you verify B's outputs without seeing B's internals?
4. Create feedback loops: When C detects failure, what happens?
5. Iterate by tightening A and strengthening C
6. Document the boundaries: What's your responsibility vs. B's responsibility?

## Where It Breaks

- When you can't define A clearly (too much ambiguity in inputs)
- When C can't detect failures (verification is impossible)
- When B is adversarial (actively trying to break A or hide from C)
- When there's no budget for C (verification costs time/money)

## Who It's For

Engineers, governance designers, AI builders, founders, anyone building systems that must work despite uncertainty

## Examples

- **LLM in production**: A = input format and constraints, B = the LLM (don't trust it), C = output validation checking for hallucination, toxicity, format compliance
- **Third-party vendor**: A = expected output format, B = vendor (they might fail), C = auditing their outputs against A
- **Org process**: A = input requirements (who decides, what info is needed), B = decision-maker (they might be biased or wrong), C = outcomes review (does the decision actually work?)

## Observable Outcomes

- Ability to work with unreliable systems safely
- Faster detection of problems (C catches them)
- Reduced catastrophic failures (B can fail, but it won't break the whole system)
- Clearer responsibility (A, B, C each know their job)
