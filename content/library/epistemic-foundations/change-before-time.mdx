title: Change-Before-Time (Observable Change)
excerpt: Time is not fundamental — change is. The meaningful unit is what changed, how it was measured, and what the observer had access to.

## What It Is

Time is not fundamental — change is. The meaningful unit is: what changed, how was it measured, and what did the observer have access to? Most narratives about change over time are actually just stories. Real change is observable delta across defined dimensions.

## What It Produces

- Delta-based reasoning (change measured in specific, comparable units)
- "Change physics" (understanding how systems actually transform)
- Progress systems based on observable movement (not narrative)
- Ability to distinguish signal from story

## When to Use It

- When narratives are dominating over metrics
- When someone says "over time people..." without data
- When evaluating personal growth or skill development
- When comparing institutional change
- When tracking progress toward a goal
- When trying to understand whether something actually improved

## How to Apply It

1. Define the delta explicitly: What, exactly, changed?
2. Define the measurement: How will you measure this change?
3. Define the observer: Who has access to this information? Can they verify it?
4. Define the time window: Over what period did this change occur?
5. Track the delta directly instead of storytelling about it
6. Distinguish between different types of change (growth, oscillation, decay, transformation)
7. Show the trajectory, not just the narrative

## Where It Breaks

- When the change is qualitative and hard to measure
- When feedback loops are too slow
- When measurement changes during the period (moving goalposts)
- When the observer position matters (everyone sees different deltas)

## Who It's For

Product builders, political analysts, personal growth designers, anyone trying to track whether something is actually working

## Examples

- **Personal development**: Not "I've grown a lot" but "My decision speed increased from X to Y" (measurable delta)
- **Org change**: Not "We got more collaborative" but "Meeting time dropped 20%, decision speed increased 30%" (specific deltas)
- **Political change**: Not "Things got worse" but "Unemployment went from X% to Y%, inflation from A% to B%" (observable change)

## Observable Outcomes

- Clear understanding of what actually changed vs. what people claim changed
- Ability to tell whether progress is real or narrative
- Better feedback loops (you see what's working)
- Reduced time spent on storytelling (focus on measurable movement)
