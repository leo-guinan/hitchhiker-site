## What It Is

Systems drift when they lose feedback loops. Claims matter only if they stay anchored to measurable reality. The more removed a system is from falsifiability, the more it drifts into abstraction and vibes.

## What It Produces

- Falsifiable hypotheses (testable claims, not just assertions)
- Stronger causal claims (tied to measurable outcomes)
- Less memetic drift (ideas don't float away from what works)
- Early detection of system dysfunction (before it becomes crisis)

## When to Use It

- When ideas are becoming vibes (people nod but nothing changes)
- When a community is spiraling (talking in circles, no new information)
- When you feel yourself floating into abstraction
- When a strategy has been running for months with no measurable outcome
- When people claim success but can't point to concrete evidence

## How to Apply It

1. Ask: "What would falsify this claim?" (What evidence would prove it wrong?)
2. Ask: "What observation would change my mind?" (What do you need to see?)
3. Demand an outcome anchor: How will we know this worked?
4. Define measurable success before running the test
5. Set a falsification deadline (when will we know if this is wrong?)
6. Track the metric (don't just hope, observe)
7. Update when reality speaks

## Where It Breaks

- When incentives reward legibility over truth (saying something sounds good matters more than whether it works)
- When feedback loops are too slow to observe
- When measuring the outcome is harder than doing the thing
- When powerful people benefit from not knowing the answer

## Who It's For

Everyone building in complex systems, founders, product managers, researchers, anyone trying to avoid self-deception

## Examples

- **Strategy**: "We'll build community" → Becomes "We'll have 100 active members by June who produce X value" → Measurable, falsifiable
- **Framework**: "This framework works" → Becomes "Teams using this will make 20% better decisions" → Testable, with deadline
- **Hiring**: "This person is talented" → Becomes "They will complete X in Y weeks at Z quality level" → Observable

## Observable Outcomes

- Faster iteration (you know what works instead of guessing)
- Better decision-making (based on evidence, not narrative)
- Less organizational drift (people stay connected to reality)
- Higher execution quality (feedback loops enable course correction)
