excerpt: Operational trust through feedback loops and verification. Building systems where trust is earned and observable, not assumed.

## What It Is

TrustOps is the practice of creating operational trust through feedback loops and verification. Instead of trusting by default or by role, you design systems where trust is earned through observable behavior, verified outcomes, and clear contracts. Trust becomes something you can audit and maintain.

## What It Produces

- Trust that scales without naïveté
- Clear verification points (how do we know someone did what they said?)
- Feedback loops that correct when trust is misplaced
- Reduced dependence on "good people" (structure does the work)

## When to Use It

- Building teams or communities where accountability matters
- Designing coordination between parties who don't have long history
- Creating systems that must resist capture or defection
- When "we just need to trust each other" isn't enough

## How to Apply It

1. **Define the contract**: What exactly is each party committing to? Make it observable.
2. **Build verification**: How will we know if the commitment was kept? (Artifacts, witnesses, metrics.)
3. **Create feedback loops**: When verification fails, what happens? (Not punishment-first—correction, then escalation.)
4. **Separate roles**: Who acts (A), what's being verified (B), who verifies (C). Don't let A verify themselves.
5. **Make trust revocable**: Exits and consequences must be possible. Trust without exit is capture.
6. **Document the stack**: TrustOps + Reality Contact + ABC Systems = auditable coordination.

## Where It Breaks

- When verification is too expensive or impossible
- When parties refuse to make commitments observable
- When the system rewards legibility over truth (gaming verification)
- When there's no clean exit (trust becomes trap)

## Who It's For

Community builders, team leads, protocol designers, anyone building coordination systems

## Observable Outcomes

- Coordination that scales without bureaucracy
- Trust that doesn't depend on charisma or tenure
- Faster detection of broken commitments
- Clearer expectations (everyone knows what "keeping trust" means)
