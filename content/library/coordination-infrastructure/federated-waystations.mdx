title: Federated Waystations
excerpt: Small high-context networks with shared interfaces. Coordination that scales through federation, not centralization.

## What It Is

Federated Waystations are small, high-context networks (waystations) that connect through shared interfaces and protocols. Instead of one big platform or one big community, you have many small nodes that can interoperate—shared identity, shared norms, or shared technical standards—without requiring a single central authority.

## What It Produces

- Scale without centralization (no single point of failure or capture)
- High context where it matters (small groups) and interoperability where it helps (federation)
- Resilience (if one waystation fails, others continue)
- Diversity of culture with ability to coordinate (different nodes, shared interface)

## When to Use It

- When you want community that scales but don't want a single platform
- When centralization has already caused capture or drift
- When different groups need different norms but need to work together
- When building the "network of networks" for coordination

## How to Apply It

1. **Define the waystation**: What's the boundary of one node? (Size, purpose, norms.) Keep it small enough for high context.
2. **Define the interface**: What do waystations share? (Identity standard, reputation schema, communication protocol, shared vocabulary.)
3. **Enable federation**: How do waystations connect? (Introductions, shared events, technical interoperability.)
4. **Protect local sovereignty**: Each waystation owns its norms. Federation doesn't mean homogenization.
5. **Design for exit and entry**: People can leave one waystation and join another. Waystations can form and dissolve. Clean exits at every level.
6. **Resist re-centralization**: When someone says "we need one big one," ask: can we federate instead?

## Where It Breaks

- When the shared interface is too weak (waystations can't actually coordinate)
- When the shared interface is too strong (federation becomes centralization through standards)
- When waystations don't trust each other (no protocol fixes that without relationship)
- When there's no path for new waystations to form (network becomes closed)

## Who It's For

Community builders, protocol designers, anyone building coordination infrastructure that should resist capture and scale through federation

## Observable Outcomes

- Multiple thriving nodes instead of one fragile center
- Coordination across boundaries without loss of local context
- New waystations can form and plug in (open federation)
- Failure of one node doesn't collapse the network
