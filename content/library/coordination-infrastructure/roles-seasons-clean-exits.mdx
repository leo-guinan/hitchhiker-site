## Roles as Temporary Identities

### What It Is

A role is not who you "are"—it's a bounded set of behaviors for a specific game. Good roles have clear boundaries (what the role does/doesn't do), observable behaviors (how you know if you're playing it well), entry conditions (what's required to take it), and exit conditions (when/how you leave).

### What It Produces

- Ability to play multiple roles without identity fragmentation
- Clear expectations (people know what you're supposed to do)
- Clean exits (leaving doesn't mean failure)
- Flickering capability (you can switch between games without being illegible)

### How to Apply It

1. **Define the role behaviorally**: What specific actions define this role?
2. **Specify entry requirements**: What capability/commitment is needed to play this role?
3. **Define success observable**: How do others know if you're playing this role well?
4. **Set exit conditions**: When/how does someone leave this role?
5. **Create rituals**: How do they enter (commitment) and exit (completion)?
6. **Make clear it's temporary**: This role ends. You don't become this identity forever.

### Examples

- **Good role**: "Sprint coordinator for this 2-week cycle. Responsible for scheduling, tracking blockers, ensuring shipping. Role ends when sprint ends."
- **Bad role**: "VP of Culture" (infinite scope, no success criteria, no exit)
- **Good role**: "Guest professor teaching one course this semester. Teach, evaluate, mentor. Role ends when semester ends."

## Seasons as Bounded Commitment

### What It Is

A season is a commitment to stable rules for a defined time period. Seasons solve the commitment paradox: how do you get full commitment without permanent capture? Everyone knows the game will end, so they can go all-in without fear of being trapped.

### What It Produces

- Strong commitment without permanent lock-in
- Learning windows (time to run experiments and see results)
- Clean comparison points (you can compare across seasons)
- Expected transitions (changing is normal, not failure)

### How to Apply It

1. **Define duration**: How long is one season? (Be specific: "January-March" not "a few months")
2. **Keep rules stable**: Don't change the game mid-season. Changes happen between seasons.
3. **Define completion**: When does this season end? What's the closing ceremony?
4. **Plan next season**: Before this one ends, what's coming next?
5. **Honor the season rhythm**: Make transitions explicit and ceremonial
6. **Iterate based on learnings**: What did you learn? What changes for next season?

### Examples

- **Good season**: "Q1 focus on acquisition. Clear metrics, everyone knows what we're measuring, season ends March 31st. Then we evaluate and set Q2 priorities."
- **Bad season**: "Continuous improvement" (no end, rules keep changing, no clear evaluation point)
- **Good season**: "Summer cohort runs June-August. Same curriculum every year. New cohort each summer. Clear graduation."

## Clean Exits as Designed Feature

### What It Is

A clean exit means leaving a role/game/community without damage to reputation or relationships. Most jobs/projects/communities have toxic exits (leaving is treated as failure). Clean exits require designed transition processes, handoff documentation, and reputation preservation.

### What It Produces

- People willing to join (they know they can leave)
- Smooth transitions (no chaos when people move)
- Reputation preservation (departure doesn't damage your standing)
- Sustainable participation (people can leave without guilt)

### How to Apply It

1. **Design exit rituals**: How do people ceremonially leave? (Not just "I quit.")
2. **Create handoff templates**: What knowledge must transfer? Make it explicit.
3. **Preserve reputation**: Exiting well should be celebrated, not punished
4. **Enable re-entry**: Good people might come back. Don't burn bridges.
5. **Alumni networks**: Keep connections alive after people leave
6. **Document the contribution**: Make clear what they did, not just when they left

### Examples

- **Good exit**: Formal end-of-project ceremony, documentation of what was built, alumni network for staying connected, doors open for future collaboration
- **Bad exit**: Person just stops showing up, no transition, knowledge is lost, they're considered a failure for leaving
- **Good exit**: Semester ends, professor gets thank you, their work is documented, they're invited to teach again next year

### Observable Outcomes (All Three)

- People know what's expected of them
- Roles can end without identity damage
- Higher engagement (people go all-in because it's bounded)
- Smoother transitions (expected, planned)
- People more willing to commit fully (they know they can exit)
