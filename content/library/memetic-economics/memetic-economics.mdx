## What It Is

Memetic Economics is the study of recognition, legitimacy, and narrative as economic infrastructure. Ideas don't spread by truth alone—they spread through networks of attention, trust, and status. Value flows through narrative as much as through product. Understanding this lets you price, position, and distribute work in alignment with how ideas actually move.

## What It Produces

- Understanding why some ideas win and others don't
- Models of how legitimacy compounds (or decays)
- Clarity on what you're actually selling (insight, access, identity, narrative)
- Pricing and positioning that match the real economy of attention

## When to Use It

- Pricing your work (consulting, content, frameworks)
- Understanding why a competitor's worse product is winning
- Building or evaluating narrative strategy
- Deciding what to give away vs. what to monetize
- Understanding institutional politics (academic, corporate, ecosystem)

## How to Apply It

1. **Map the recognition flow**: Who gets credit for what? How does it compound?
2. **Identify the legitimacy source**: Where does "this is real" come from? (Institutions, peers, outcomes, narrative.)
3. **Track narrative as capital**: What stories are in circulation? Who benefits?
4. **Price for the real economy**: Are you selling time, outcome, access, or narrative? Price accordingly.
5. **Design for compound legitimacy**: How does each piece of work increase the value of the next? (Compression Ladders, Framework Development Partnerships.)
6. **Watch for decay**: Legitimacy that isn't renewed (through reality contact, new work) decays. Plan for refresh.

## Where It Breaks

- When you optimize for narrative over truth (short-term win, long-term collapse)
- When legitimacy is too opaque to map (you can't see the game)
- When the market rewards something you're not offering (wrong product for the economy)
- When you confuse your narrative with your value (narrative is a channel, not the product)

## Who It's For

Creators pricing their work, founders understanding narrative value, VCs evaluating legitimacy risk, researchers navigating academic politics, anyone monetizing frameworks or consulting

## Observable Outcomes

- Better pricing intuition
- Understanding why ideas spread (or don't)
- Design patterns for sustainable creator businesses
- Models of institutional legitimacy decay and renewal
