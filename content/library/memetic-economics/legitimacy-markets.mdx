excerpt: How narrative coordination creates value. Where legitimacy comes from, how it trades, and how it decays.

## What It Is

Legitimacy Markets are the (often implicit) systems where legitimacy is produced, traded, and consumed. Who gets to say what's "real," "serious," or "important"? How does that authority compound or decay? Legitimacy isn't just reputation—it's the right to be taken seriously in a given context. Understanding legitimacy markets lets you navigate them and design for sustainable legitimacy.

## What It Produces

- Maps of who has legitimacy in a given domain (and why)
- Understanding of how legitimacy compounds (institutions, peers, track record)
- Predictions of legitimacy decay (when institutions lose credibility)
- Design choices that build or preserve legitimacy

## When to Use It

- Entering a new field or institution (who has legitimacy here?)
- Understanding why certain voices are heard and others aren't
- Building something that needs to be taken seriously (how do you earn legitimacy?)
- Evaluating institutional risk (is this organization's legitimacy decaying?)

## How to Apply It

1. **Map the sources**: Where does legitimacy come from in this context? (Credentials, outcomes, peers, narrative.)
2. **Trace the flows**: Who grants legitimacy to whom? (Institutions → individuals, peers → peers, outcomes → credibility.)
3. **Identify the currency**: What counts as "legitimate" here? (Citations, revenue, credentials, community endorsement.)
4. **Check for decay**: Is legitimacy being renewed (reality contact, new work) or living on past credit?
5. **Design your strategy**: Build legitimacy through the channels that matter in this market. Don't optimize for the wrong currency.
6. **Watch for capture**: When legitimacy is gamed (metrics replace substance), the market is distorted. Position for the correction.

## Where It Breaks

- When legitimacy is too opaque (you can't see who has it or why)
- When the market is captured (legitimacy doesn't track quality)
- When you're optimizing for a legitimacy market that's decaying (wrong bet)
- When you need legitimacy faster than the market grants it (patience or different market)

## Who It's For

Founders, researchers, creators, anyone navigating institutions or building credibility

## Observable Outcomes

- Clearer picture of "how things work here"
- Better bets on where to invest credibility-building effort
- Ability to spot legitimacy decay (and position for the shift)
- Fewer surprises when "obvious" authorities lose standing
