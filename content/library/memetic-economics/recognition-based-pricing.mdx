## What It Is

Recognition-Based Pricing is the practice of pricing your work in alignment with what you're actually selling in the attention/legitimacy economy. You're not just selling time or deliverables—you're selling recognition (being known for something), access (relationship, network), and narrative (story, identity). Price for the value that flows through those channels.

## What It Produces

- Pricing that matches value (not just hours)
- Clarity on what buyers are actually paying for (insight, access, status, narrative)
- Multiple price points for different value layers (product vs. service vs. relationship)
- Sustainable revenue from depth work (you're not undercharging for pattern recognition)

## When to Use It

- Pricing consulting, coaching, or advisory work
- Deciding what to put behind a paywall vs. give away
- Building tiers (free content, paid product, premium access)
- Understanding why some people charge 10x for similar-looking work

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify what you're selling**: Time? Outcome? Access? Recognition? Narrative? (Often it's a mix; be explicit.)
2. **Map the buyer's value**: What are they actually buying? (Better decisions, legitimacy by association, access to you, story to tell.)
3. **Price for the real value**: If they're buying access to your network, price for that. If they're buying the framework, price for that. Don't price everything as "hours."
4. **Use tiers**: Free (G2 fragments, spread), Paid product (structured framework, depth), Paid service (coaching, access, implementation). Each tier captures different value.
5. **Connect to Compression Ladders**: Different compressions = different products = different price points. One body of work, multiple revenue streams.
6. **Avoid undercharging for recognition**: If your name or association is part of the value, price it. Pattern recognition is expensive to develop; charge accordingly.

## Where It Breaks

- When you overprice for your actual legitimacy (market won't pay)
- When you underprice because you're selling "time" (you're leaving value on the table)
- When the buyer doesn't understand what they're paying for (alignment failure)
- When you're in a market that only pays for deliverables (recognition has no price there)

## Who It's For

Consultants, coaches, creators, anyone monetizing frameworks or expertise

## Observable Outcomes

- Revenue that reflects the full value you provide
- Clearer value proposition (you know what you're selling)
- Tiers that make sense (free/paid/premium aligned with value layers)
- Better intuition for "what can I charge?" in new contexts
