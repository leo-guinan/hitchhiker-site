title: Observable Games vs. Algorithmic Capture
excerpt: Sports create real reputation through observable outcomes. Social media creates fake reputation through algorithmic signals.

## What It Is

Sports create real reputation through observable outcomes. Social media creates fake reputation through algorithmic signals. Observable games have seasons, scoreboards, referees, and spectators. Algorithmic systems have only engagement metrics and opaque amplification.

## What It Produces

- Understanding why current platforms drift away from reality
- Design principles for games that don't get captured
- Ability to spot fake games (no real outcomes)
- Infrastructure that preserves accountability

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether a system is actually measuring what it claims
- Designing communities or incentive structures
- Understanding why organizations get worse at their actual job while metrics improve
- Building platforms that should maintain integrity over time

## How to Apply It

1. **Check for seasons**: Does the game have bounded time? Or does it go forever?
2. **Check for scoreboards**: Is there a shared measure everyone agrees on? Or personalized metrics?
3. **Check for referees**: Is there rule enforcement independent of players? Or do strong players control interpretation?
4. **Check for spectators**: Can others verify outcomes? Or are they opaque?
5. **Check for exits**: Can people leave cleanly? Or is leaving treated as failure?
6. **Check for capture**: Is winning disconnected from external reality? (Classic capture symptom)

## Where It Breaks

- When spectators are lazy or corrupt
- When the scoreboard is gamed (refs are incompetent)
- When real outcomes are hard to measure
- When powerful players can rewrite rules mid-game

## Who It's For

Platform designers, community builders, game designers, anyone trying to build systems that maintain integrity

## Examples

- **Real game**: Sports league. Seasons (clear start/end), scoreboard (everyone agrees on score), referees (enforce rules), spectators (verify outcomes). Reputation is hard to fake.
- **Captured game**: Twitter. No seasons (algorithm runs forever), personalized metrics (different people see different scores), opaque algorithm (can't verify), no exits (leaving is failure). Reputation is entirely fake.
- **Real game**: Open source. Seasons (project milestones), scoreboard (code quality, maintenance), referees (maintainers accept/reject), spectators (anyone can review). Real contribution is visible.
- **Captured game**: Corporate KPIs. No seasons (goals shift constantly), metrics chosen by management, goals set by company, no spectators, leaving is failure. People optimize metrics instead of outcomes.

## Observable Outcomes

- Ability to spot systems that reward gaming over real work
- Better community design (you know what to measure)
- More resilient organizations (you've separated roles properly)
- Higher trust (outcomes are verifiable, not claimed)
