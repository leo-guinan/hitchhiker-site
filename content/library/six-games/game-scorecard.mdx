title: The Game Scorecard (Capability/Interest/Activity/Fit)
excerpt: A structured scoring system for evaluating your relationship to each of the six games.

## What It Is

A structured scoring system for evaluating your relationship to each of the six games. It separates what you're good at (capability), what you enjoy (interest), what you're currently doing (activity), and whether it fits you (natural fit).

## What It Produces

- Your "primary game" (which game should you focus on?)
- Underutilized games (which could you play better?)
- Wasted effort (which are you doing but shouldn't be?)
- Development opportunities (which games would strengthen you?)

## When to Use It

- Annual self-assessment
- When you feel stuck or directionless
- Before making career changes
- When evaluating whether your time allocation makes sense
- When deciding what to learn next

## How to Apply It

1. For each game (G1-G6), rate yourself on:
   - **Capability** (0-10): How good are you at playing this game?
   - **Interest** (0-10): How much do you enjoy this game?
   - **Current Activity** (0-10): How much are you currently playing?
   - **Natural Fit** (0-10): How naturally does this come to you?
2. For high-capability games, provide evidence (specific examples of you playing well)
3. Identify gaps: Capability > Activity (underutilized)? Activity > Capability (wasted effort)?
4. Find your primary game: Highest combined score, highest natural fit
5. Make decisions based on alignment: Are you playing the games that fit you?

## Where It Breaks

- When you score yourself dishonestly (self-assessment bias)
- When you confuse aspiration with capability
- When you don't have evidence to back up scores
- When your circumstances force you to play games you don't fit

## Who It's For

Anyone trying to understand their own work and trajectory, founders building teams, people making career decisions

## Examples

- **Scoring G3 (Model Building)**: Capability 8, Interest 9, Activity 3, Fit 9 → You're underutilizing your strongest game. Should prioritize it.
- **Scoring G5 (Meaning-making)**: Capability 4, Interest 2, Activity 8, Fit 2 → You're wasting effort on something that doesn't fit. Stop.
- **Scoring G6 (Network)**: Capability 7, Interest 6, Activity 2, Fit 6 → Could play more, might complement your primary game.

## Observable Outcomes

- Clearer sense of what work energizes vs. drains you
- Better alignment between capability and activity
- Identification of meaningful next steps
- Reduced wasted effort on bad-fit games
