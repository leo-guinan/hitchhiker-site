## What It Is

There are six distinct games that create value in knowledge work and culture. Each game answers a different question. Most frustration comes from mixing games, playing the wrong one for your season, or being evaluated by the wrong game's rules.

## What It Produces

- Role clarity (which game are you playing?)
- A map of outputs (what does each game actually produce?)
- Recognition of fake work (things that feel productive but aren't)
- Developmental direction (which game comes next for you?)

## When to Use It

- Understanding your own career trajectory
- Explaining why you keep changing direction
- Building a team with complementary games
- Evaluating whether your output matches your effort
- Understanding why two smart people produce completely different value
- Deciding what to focus on next

## The Six Games

### G1 — Identity / Canon

**Question**: Who should people become—and who should they study?

**Creates**: Lineage, taste, belonging

**Outputs**: Heroes, texts, archetypes, norms

**Value**: Authority through curation, trust through consistency

**Roles**: Curator, canon-builder, tradition-keeper, taste-maker

**Failure modes**: Dogmatism, gatekeeping, rejecting valid outside perspectives

**Key insight**: G1 stabilizes identity after exploration. Starting here too early freezes growth.

### G2 — Idea Mining

**Question**: What can we extract and apply right now?

**Creates**: Actionable insights, portable tactics

**Outputs**: Plays, frameworks, how-tos, summaries

**Value**: Compression (long→short), transfer (then→now)

**Roles**: Extractor, translator, tactical advisor, synthesizer

**Failure modes**: Vague inspiration, shallow remixing, loss of concreteness

**Key insight**: G2 is exploration and scavenging. It feeds everything—but cannot stand alone.

### G3 — Model Building

**Question**: How does this actually work?

**Creates**: Understanding, explanatory coherence

**Outputs**: Models, maps, causal structures, frameworks

**Value**: Reduced confusion, better reasoning, new possibilities visible

**Roles**: Systems thinker, model-builder, framework designer, theorist

**Failure modes**: Over-abstraction, detachment from reality, analysis paralysis

**Key insight**: High G3 produces clarity—and eventually ego death when clarity exceeds direction.

### G4 — Performance / Coaching

**Question**: How do you get better results?

**Creates**: Measurable improvement over time

**Outputs**: Practice systems, feedback loops, coaching, skill development

**Value**: Capability building, transformation, embodied skill

**Roles**: Coach, trainer, performance optimizer, systems engineer

**Failure modes**: Generic advice, loss of accountability, optimizing the wrong goal

**Key insight**: G4 converts understanding into embodied skill—but without values (G5), it drifts.

### G5 — Meaning / Sensemaking

**Question**: What does this mean for how I want to live?

**Creates**: Orientation, coherence, values clarity

**Outputs**: Narrative, interpretation, reflection, direction

**Value**: Emotional grounding, direction in uncertainty, wise decision-making

**Roles**: Sensemaker, interpreter, philosopher, guide

**Failure modes**: Vague therapy, spiritual bypassing, loss of rigor

**Key insight**: G5 is not chosen—it emerges. It acts as a values-based filter that determines what G4 practices you'll actually do and what G6 networks you'll join.

### G6 — Network / Coordination

**Question**: Who should be connected—and how?

**Creates**: Trust transfer, collaboration, coordination

**Outputs**: Communities, introductions, orchestrated work, ecosystem

**Value**: Access, leverage through network position, compound learning

**Roles**: Connector, matchmaker, community architect, network curator

**Failure modes**: Shallow networking, status optimization, coordination without depth

**Key insight**: Healthy G6 depends on G5 filtering. Without it, networks implode into status games.

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify your current game**: Which one are you playing right now?
2. **Score yourself**: Rate capability (0-10) and current activity (0-10) for each game
3. **Find underutilized games**: What could you do better that you're not doing?
4. **Identify your primary game**: Which one comes most naturally?
5. **Understand the progression**: Where does your game naturally lead?
6. **Make conscious game switches**: Don't drift between games—choose

## Where It Breaks

- When you try to play all six games equally (dilutes all of them)
- When you stay in one game too long (you drift or burn out)
- When games collapse into each other (G3 masquerades as G1, etc.)
- When the game doesn't have clear outcomes (fake games)

## Who It's For

Creators, researchers, founders, product builders, anyone trying to understand their own work trajectory

## Examples

- **Creator A**: Plays high G2 (tactical frameworks, how-tos). Works great but eventually plateaus—needs G3 to go deeper.
- **Creator B**: Plays high G3 (building models, explaining systems). Creates clarity but can feel directionless—needs G5 to orient.
- **Founder C**: Plays G4 (coaching teams, building capability). Creates growth but can optimize for the wrong goals—needs G5 values filter.
- **Leader D**: Plays G6 (coordinating people). Creates community but can become shallow—needs G5 values anchor.

## Observable Outcomes

- Clarity about what you actually do vs. what you think you do
- Ability to see why some work feels energizing and some draining
- Recognition of what's next for your development
- Capacity to play multiple games without losing integrity
