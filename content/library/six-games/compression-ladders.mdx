## What It Is

A model for turning deep frameworks into portable outputs and applied outcomes. G3 (Model) builds understanding → G2 (Idea Mining) compresses into accessible fragments → G4 (Performance) applies to real-world performance. It's the path from insight to impact.

## What It Produces

- A stable path from insight → distribution → coaching
- Integrated product and marketing (the distribution IS the product)
- Leverage for deep thinkers (your models can reach people at all levels)
- Multiple revenue models from one deep work

## When to Use It

- You have deep frameworks you want to share
- You want to build products from research
- You're trying to create leverage
- You want to monetize your thinking

## How to Apply It

1. **G3 (Deep Work)**: Build the full model/framework. Get it right. Test it against reality.
2. **Compress to G2**: Extract the core insights. Make them actionable. Remove the jargon.
3. **Package for G4**: Show how to apply this. Create practice systems. Build coaching frameworks.
4. **Route to different audiences**:
   - Experts want the full G3 model
   - Intermediate learners want G2 (tactical versions)
   - Practitioners want G4 (how to use it)
5. **Sell at multiple levels**:
   - Free: G2 fragments (blog posts, tweets, email course)
   - Paid product: Structured G2 (guides, frameworks)
   - Paid service: G4 coaching (applying it to their situation)

## Where It Breaks

- When you skip G3 (try to distribute before you have real understanding)
- When compression loses the magic (G2 becomes obvious/useless)
- When G4 isn't actually coaching (just telling people to apply it)
- When you try to compress for everyone (different audiences need different compressions)

## Who It's For

Researchers, framework builders, educators, founders building intellectual products

## Examples

- **Physics education**: G3 (deep theory) → G2 (key concepts, why they matter) → G4 (how to solve problems with them)
- **Business consulting**: G3 (deep models of how business works) → G2 (tactical plays extracted from the model) → G4 (coaching on implementing the plays)
- **AI Safety**: G3 (deep alignment theory) → G2 (key insights about failure modes) → G4 (how to implement safety practices)

## Observable Outcomes

- Your ideas reach people at all levels
- Multiple revenue streams from one body of work
- Better understanding through compression (forces clarity)
- Higher impact (compounded through distribution)
