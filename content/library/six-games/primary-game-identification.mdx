## What It Is

Primary Game Identification is the practice of determining which of the six games you should focus on at this stage of your development. It's not "what are you good at" in the abstract—it's "which game, if you played it more, would produce the most value and alignment for you right now?"

## What It Produces

- A clear answer to "what should I actually be doing?"
- Reduced scattered effort across wrong games
- Better coordination through role clarity
- Legible capability despite identity flux

## When to Use It

- When you feel scattered across too many types of work
- When you're unclear on positioning (consulting, creating, building)
- When you've crossed a threshold (high G3, identity dissolved) and need direction
- When teams are trying to evaluate contribution and don't have a shared frame
- When you're post-identity and need a game-based way to describe what you do

## How to Apply It

1. **Score yourself** on the Game Scorecard (capability, interest, activity, fit for each of G1–G6).
2. **Find underutilized games**: Where is Capability > Activity? Those are games you could play more.
3. **Find wasted effort**: Where is Activity > Capability or Fit? Those are games you might be playing out of habit or obligation.
4. **Identify primary game**: The game with highest combined score *and* highest natural fit. Often the one you're best at *and* most energized by.
5. **Check the progression**: Does your primary game lead naturally to the next game you need? (e.g. G3 clarity → G5 direction → G4 or G6 application)
6. **Commit for a season**: Play your primary game deliberately for a bounded period. Don't flicker unless you're designed to.

## Where It Breaks

- When you don't have evidence (only aspiration) for your scores
- When circumstances force you to play a different game (survival vs. fit)
- When you have multiple high-fit games and refuse to choose (dilution)
- When "primary" becomes identity (you're playing a role, not becoming it)

## Who It's For

Polymaths who feel illegible despite being capable, consultants unclear on positioning, creators fragmented across platforms, anyone post-threshold (high G3, identity flux)

## Examples

- **Underutilized G3**: You're doing mostly G2 (tactical content). Your best work is model-building. Primary game = G3. Shift time toward frameworks and causal maps.
- **Wasted G5**: You're spending a lot of time on meaning-making but it doesn't fit and you're not good at it. Primary game might be G4 or G6. Reduce G5, invest in fit.
- **Natural G6**: High capability and fit in network/coordination. Activity is low. Primary game = G6. Design a season where you play connector explicitly.

## Observable Outcomes

- Clear answer to "what should I actually be doing?"
- Stop wasting effort on wrong games
- Better coordination through role clarity
- Legible capability despite identity flux
