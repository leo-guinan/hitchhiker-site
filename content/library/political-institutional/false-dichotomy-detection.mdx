title: False Dichotomy Detection (Binary Compression Failure)
excerpt: Systems compress multi-dimensional reality into binaries, then act surprised when the binary fails.

## What It Is

Systems compress multi-dimensional reality into binaries, then act surprised when the binary fails. Most culture wars, political divisions, and strategic debates are actually axis collapse — collapsing a multi-dimensional space into a line and pretending that's the only way to see it.

## What It Produces

- Decompression strategies (expanding the conversation space)
- Multi-axis models (showing the actual geometry)
- "Which axes are being collapsed?" insight (naming the compression)
- Solutions that don't exist in the binary frame

## When to Use It

- Culture wars (left/right, progressive/conservative)
- "AI good vs. AI bad" debates
- Single-metric optimization (maximizing engagement, growth, etc.)
- "Either we do X or Y" false choices
- When people seem to be talking past each other
- When the obvious positions both seem obviously wrong

## How to Apply It

1. Identify what got collapsed: What's being reduced to a binary?
2. Identify the original dimensions: What are the axes being compressed?
3. Map the actual space: Show the geometry in 2D/3D
4. Propose alternatives: What solutions exist in the expanded space?
5. Show how the binary created false dichotomy: Why did this seem like the only choice?
6. Expand the conversation: What becomes possible with more axes?

## Where It Breaks

- When people *benefit* from the binary (easier to win)
- When genuinely only two options exist (rare, but real)
- When additional dimensions aren't measurable
- When the expanded space is too complex to navigate

## Who It's For

Mediators, analysts, theorists, ML evaluation people, anyone trying to solve "unsolvable" problems

## Examples

- **Remote vs. Office**: Binary collapses time, location, collaboration quality, synchronization speed, autonomy. Real solution uses all axes.
- **AI Safety vs. Capability**: Binary creates competition. Expanded frame shows both matter differently for different contexts.
- **Growth vs. Sustainability**: Binary creates false choice. Expanded frame shows sustainable growth exists at different scales.
- **Standardization vs. Customization**: Binary creates tension. Real solution uses both at different layers.

## Observable Outcomes

- Solutions to problems that seemed intractable
- Reduced polarization (expanded frame makes space for different positions)
- Better strategy (you're playing multi-dimensional game, not one-dimensional war)
- Faster convergence (people stop fighting about the binary, start exploring the space)
