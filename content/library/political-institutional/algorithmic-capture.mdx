## What It Is

When optimization targets replace reality. Systems start measuring one thing and end up optimizing for the measure instead of the outcome. The metric becomes the goal; the original goal drifts out of view. This is how platforms, institutions, and teams lose contact with what they were actually trying to do.

## What It Produces

- Recognition of when metrics have replaced mission
- Understanding why "good numbers" don't mean good outcomes
- Design principles for capture-resistant systems
- Ability to spot gaming before it becomes existential

## When to Use It

- When metrics keep improving but outcomes feel wrong
- When designing incentive systems or KPIs
- When evaluating platform or institutional claims
- When "engagement" or "growth" dominates decision-making
- When you're building systems that should maintain integrity over time

## How to Apply It

1. **Identify the proxy**: What is being measured instead of the real outcome?
2. **Trace the incentive**: What behavior does this metric reward?
3. **Ask**: Can you game this without creating real value?
4. **Check reality contact**: Is there a feedback loop that corrects when the metric diverges from truth?
5. **Design for verification**: Can observers (referees, spectators) check outcomes independently?
6. **Test for capture**: If everyone optimized this metric, would the system still serve its purpose?

## Where It Breaks

- When the real outcome is unobservable or too slow to measure
- When powerful actors benefit from the capture
- When there's no independent verification possible
- When the system is too complex to trace cause and effect

## Who It's For

Platform designers, org designers, anyone building or evaluating incentive systems, researchers studying institutional drift

## Examples

- **Social media**: Optimize for engagement → creators optimize for engagement → quality and truth decay. Capture.
- **Academic publishing**: Optimize for citations → researchers optimize for citations → reproducibility and impact suffer. Capture.
- **Corporate KPIs**: Optimize for quarterly revenue → teams optimize for quarterly revenue → long-term health erodes. Capture.
- **Observable game**: Scoreboard measures real wins → players try to win → metric and outcome align. No capture.

## Observable Outcomes

- Earlier detection of metric drift
- Systems that resist gaming
- Clearer separation between "what we measure" and "what we want"
- Better alignment between incentives and outcomes
