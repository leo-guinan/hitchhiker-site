title: Validation Distance Problem
excerpt: The cost to verify a claim increases exponentially with distance from where it was created. Systems far from the source optimize for legibility instead of truth.

## What It Is

The cost to verify a claim increases exponentially with distance from where it was created. At each hop away from reality, context is lost. Systems far from the source optimize for legibility (what travels well) instead of truth (what works). This explains why distant expertise is fragile and local knowledge is powerful.

## What It Produces

- Understanding why platforms drift toward nonsense
- Explanation for why metrics diverge from reality
- Clarity about where to trust vs. be skeptical
- Design principles for systems that maintain contact with reality

## When to Use It

- Evaluating whether someone's expertise should be trusted
- Understanding why institutions get worse at their actual job
- Designing systems that need to maintain integrity over distance
- Spotting when legibility has replaced truth

## How to Apply It

1. **Map the distance**: How many hops from where this was created/tested to where it's being used?
2. **Count the transformations**: What gets compressed, filtered, or lost at each hop?
3. **Trace the incentives**: What's being optimized for at each distance? (Truth, or legibility?)
4. **Test the invariants**: Does this claim hold locally? Hold at distance?
5. **Verify at the edge**: Can you check this against local reality?

## Where It Breaks

- When local reality is hard to access (too much context needed)
- When compression is necessary (can't avoid some loss)
- When you can't trace the pipeline
- When powerful incentives push toward legibility

## Who It's For

Researchers evaluating claims, institutional designers, platform builders, skeptics

## Examples

- **Local expert**: Software developer. Can see their code works. Validation distance ~0. Reliability very high.
- **Company level**: Manager reporting on that developer. Some loss of detail. Validation distance ~1. Reliability medium-high.
- **Industry level**: Article about "software trends." Very compressed. Validation distance ~3. Reliability low.
- **Stock market**: Fund manager betting on software company. Infinite compression. Validation distance ~5+. Reliability very low (but confidence high, false confidence).

## Observable Outcomes

- Better judgment about what to trust
- Recognition of where systems are getting captured by legibility
- Ability to spot false confidence (high confidence + distant validation = danger)
- Better institutional design (keep validation distance short)
