title: World-Model Update Rate (Cache vs. Online Learning)
excerpt: Groups differ by how often they update their mental models. Most apparent "stupidity" or "hypocrisy" is actually just different update rates.

## What It Is

Groups differ by how often they update their mental models, how strongly they trust old information, and how they respond to distribution shift. Some groups are fast learners with weak priors. Others are slow learners with strong priors. Most apparent "stupidity" or "hypocrisy" is actually just different update rates.

## What It Produces

- Explanation for apparent contradiction (they're using different mental models)
- Theory for stability vs. volatility (fast updaters oscillate, slow updaters drift)
- Predictions of group behavior during disruption
- Understanding of why groups with same values act differently

## When to Use It

- When one group looks hypocritical (they're using old mental model)
- When one coalition looks stable and another drifts
- When you need to predict how groups will respond to change
- When trying to understand generational differences
- When explaining institutional vs. individual behavior

## How to Apply It

1. Ask: What is this group optimizing for?
2. Ask: Is their update loop fast or slow? (Do they incorporate new information quickly or slowly?)
3. Ask: How strong are their priors? (Do they trust old knowledge or assume everything changes?)
4. Ask: What's their response to distribution shift? (Do they adapt to new conditions or revert to old patterns?)
5. Map the update cycle: When do they update? What triggers updates?
6. Understand apparent contradiction as different mental models at different update rates

## Where It Breaks

- When update rate is hidden (you can't see how fast they actually learn)
- When group has no common update mechanism
- When the world changes faster than anyone can adapt
- When people are deliberately using outdated models (ideology masking as belief)

## Who It's For

Political interpreters, ML folks, culture analysts, org designers, anyone trying to understand group behavior

## Examples

- **Tech vs. Traditional Business**: Tech: fast update rate (quarterly iteration), weak priors (question everything). Traditional: slow update rate (5-year plans), strong priors (trust institutional knowledge). Same decision looks different.
- **Young vs. Old**: Young: fast update rate, weak priors (learn new tech easily). Old: slow update rate, strong priors (trust experience). Apparent contradiction is update rate difference.
- **Startup vs. Enterprise**: Startup: weekly update cycle, no legacy constraints. Enterprise: annual cycle, massive legacy constraints. Looks like enterprise is stupid. It's actually just slow update architecture.

## Observable Outcomes

- Ability to predict how groups will respond to change
- Understanding apparent contradictions as model differences
- Better communication (you speak to their update rate, not the model itself)
- More charity (you see they're not wrong, just updating differently)
