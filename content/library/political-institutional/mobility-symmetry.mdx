title: Mobility Symmetry (Asymmetric Agency)
excerpt: Divergence between groups can be caused by asymmetric ability to act — not just disagreement.

## What It Is

Divergence between groups can be caused by asymmetric ability to act — not just disagreement. When one party can move and the other can't, they'll drift apart even if they want the same thing. This is how inequality compounds without anyone being intentionally bad.

## What It Produces

- Power-aware interpretations (understanding who can actually move)
- "Who can move?" analysis (mapping agency asymmetries)
- Belief drift vs. action drift separation (they disagreed, or they had to adapt?)
- Predictions of where institutional change will show up

## When to Use It

- Understanding political divergence
- Organizational change (why some teams move and others don't)
- Platform governance (why rules affect different users differently)
- Markets and liquidity (who can actually trade, who can't)
- Understanding inequality dynamics

## How to Apply It

1. Identify who has veto power (who can stop change?)
2. Identify who must adapt (who has no choice but to move?)
3. Predict where drift shows up (often as "internal churn" - people leaving because they must adapt)
4. Map the asymmetry: What can group A do that group B can't?
5. Understand divergence as outcome of asymmetric agency, not just disagreement
6. Look for where people are forced to adapt to others' choices

## Where It Breaks

- When everyone genuinely has equal agency (rare)
- When the power structure is invisible
- When people adapt without showing external signs
- When you can't distinguish choice from coercion

## Who It's For

Political theorists, org designers, institutional analysts, anyone trying to understand why groups diverge

## Examples

- **Platform power**: Platform can change algorithm. User must adapt or leave. Drift caused by asymmetric mobility.
- **Corporate change**: Executives can shift strategy. Employees must adapt their work. Divergence emerges from agency mismatch.
- **Economic divergence**: Rich have options (move, invest, change). Poor don't (stuck in place). System diverges not from disagreement but from mobility asymmetry.

## Observable Outcomes

- Better understanding of why change happens (even when no one wanted it)
- Ability to predict who will be harmed by systemic changes
- Recognition that "disagreement" is sometimes "forced adaptation"
- Better institutional design (account for asymmetric mobility)
