excerpt: "You don't need to find yourself. You need games you can play without being captured by them. Why static identity is the trap—and what replaces it."

Identity isn't something you find. It's something you **try on**—and the old systems require you to keep it on forever.

That's the trap. Static identity was required for the coordination infrastructure we inherited. Job titles. LinkedIn narratives. "What do you do?" in one sentence. But you can't stay static anymore. You're iterating faster than the forms allow.

The solution isn't "find your true self." It's **games with roles**. Roles you can enter and exit. Bounded commitments. Observable outcomes. No identity capture—you play the game, and when the season ends, you leave.

That's what we're building. Not a better identity. Better infrastructure for fluid identity.
