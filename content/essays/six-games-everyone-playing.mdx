Everyone's playing a game. Most people don't know which one. They join a community or a company thinking it's one game—then discover the rules are different. By then they're already captured.

The six games (a working framework):

1. **The Mission Game** – We're here to change X. Commitment is unbounded. Exit is betrayal.
2. **The Status Game** – We're here to be seen. The product is recognition. You're either climbing or invisible.
3. **The Transaction Game** – We're here to exchange value. Clear boundaries. Clean exits. Rare.
4. **The Learning Game** – We're here to level up. The outcome is skill. Exit when you've learned.
5. **The Building Game** – We're here to make something. The outcome is the thing. Exit when it's shipped.
6. **The Waystation Game** – We're here to rest and resupply. No capture. You leave when you're ready.

Most organizations mix several—but one usually dominates. Recognize the game before you commit. Then decide if you want to play.
