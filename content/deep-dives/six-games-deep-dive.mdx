# The Six Games Deep Dive

## Introduction

The Six Games are **modes of coordination and cognition**, not personality types, not career ladders, and not moral rankings. Each game answers a different question about how humans orient, act, learn, improve, make meaning, and connect.

Most frustration comes from *mixing games*, *playing the wrong one for the season you're in*, or *being evaluated by the rules of a different game than the one you're actually playing*.

## The Six Games

### G1 — Identity / Canon

**Question:** *Who should people become—and who should they study?*

**Creates:** Lineage, taste, belonging
**Outputs:** Heroes, texts, archetypes, norms
**Value:** Authority through curation, trust through consistency

**Roles:** Curator, canon-builder, tradition-keeper

**Failure modes:**

* Dogmatism
* Gatekeeping
* Rejecting valid outside perspectives

**Key insight:** G1 stabilizes identity *after* exploration. Starting here too early freezes growth.

---

### G2 — Idea Mining

**Question:** *What can we extract and apply right now?*

**Creates:** Actionable insights, portable tactics
**Outputs:** Plays, frameworks, how-tos
**Value:** Compression (long → short), transfer (then → now)

**Roles:** Extractor, translator, tactical advisor

**Failure modes:**

* Vague inspiration
* Shallow remixing
* Loss of concreteness

**Key insight:** G2 is exploration and scavenging. It feeds everything—but cannot stand alone.

---

### G3 — Model Building

**Question:** *How does this actually work?*

**Creates:** Understanding, explanatory coherence
**Outputs:** Models, maps, causal structures
**Value:** Reduced confusion, better reasoning

**Roles:** Systems thinker, model-builder, framework designer

**Failure modes:**

* Over-abstraction
* Detachment from reality
* Analysis paralysis

**Key insight:** High G3 produces clarity—and eventually ego death when clarity exceeds direction.

---

### G4 — Performance / Coaching

**Question:** *How do you get better results?*

**Creates:** Measurable improvement over time
**Outputs:** Practice systems, feedback loops, coaching
**Value:** Capability building, transformation

**Roles:** Coach, trainer, performance optimizer

**Failure modes:**

* Generic advice
* Loss of accountability
* Optimizing the wrong goal

**Key insight:** G4 converts understanding into embodied skill—but without values, it drifts.

---

### G5 — Meaning / Sensemaking (Emergent)

**Question:** *What does this mean for how I want to live?*

**Creates:** Orientation, coherence, values clarity
**Outputs:** Narrative, interpretation, reflection
**Value:** Emotional grounding, direction in uncertainty

**Roles:** Sensemaker, interpreter, philosopher

**Failure modes:**

* Vague therapy
* Spiritual bypassing
* Loss of rigor

**Key insight:** G5 is not chosen—it *emerges*. It acts as a values-based attractor that filters G4 practices and determines G6 alignment.

---

### G6 — Network / Coordination

**Question:** *Who should be connected—and how?*

**Creates:** Trust transfer, collaboration, coordination
**Outputs:** Communities, introductions, orchestrated work
**Value:** Access, leverage through network position

**Roles:** Connector, matchmaker, community architect

**Failure modes:**

* Shallow networking
* Status optimization
* Coordination without depth

**Key insight:** Healthy G6 depends on G5 filtering. Without it, networks implode.

---

## Core Principles

### These Are Not Personality Types

You can play different games in different contexts. Skill in one game does *not* predict skill in another.

High G2 does not imply G5 depth. High G3 does not imply G4 effectiveness.

---

### Most People Play Too Many Games Poorly

Platforms fragment attention across games:

* G2 snippets
* G3 abstractions
* G5 vibes
* G6 status

The result: shallow competence everywhere, mastery nowhere.

Better to play **one game well** than four games badly.

---

### The Natural Progressions

* **G2 exploration → G3 model building → G4 deliberate practice**
* **G3 coherence → ego death → G1 identity re-formation**
* **Sufficient development → G5 values attractor → G6 network integration**

Understanding the progression prevents stagnation.

## Developmental Seasons (How the Games Show Up Over Time)

### Season 1 — Explorer (G2 → early G3)

*"I need more inputs."*

* Consumes widely
* Collects tactics
* Samples many domains

---

### Season 2 — Synthesizer (Developing G3)

*"I'm seeing patterns."*

* Consumes frameworks
* Builds models
* Reduces confusion

---

### Season 3 — Crisis (High G3 → Ego Death)

*"I see everything but can't choose."*
**The Hitchhiker Threshold**

* Old identities break
* Direction collapses
* Consumption either stops or spikes chaotically

---

### Season 4 — Practitioner (Post-Crisis G4)

*"I need to practice, not think."*

* Seeks coaching
* Commits to routines
* Builds capability

---

### Season 5 — Aligner (Emergent G5)

*"This works—but is it right for me?"*

* Values become active filters
* Repulsion from misaligned success
* Attraction to specific people and practices

---

### Season 6 — Coordinator (G5 → G6)

*"I want to build with others."*

* Stops consuming content
* Consumes people
* Coordinates aligned work

---

## Diagnostic: What You Consume Reveals Your Season

* **Explorer:** tactics, many sources
* **Synthesizer:** models, frameworks
* **Crisis:** existential content or nothing
* **Practitioner:** coaching, training systems
* **Aligner:** values clarification, reflection
* **Coordinator:** conversations, collaborators

---

## Why Starting With G1 Is a Trap

Canon without exploration becomes brittle. Identity must be *earned through traversal*, not adopted upfront.

---

## Why High G3 Forces G1 Flexibility

When models outgrow identity, ego collapses. Survival requires returning to G1—but this time with humility and permeability.

---

## Conclusion

The Six Games are not a ladder. They are a **coordination ecology**.

Knowing which game you're in—and which one comes next—is the first step to playing well.
